## ETHICS CASE 

ACC 203 ETHICS CASE:  Brixton Surgical Devices

Brixton Surgical Devices, a public company with sales of over $800 million, is one of the world’s largest producers of surgical clamps, saws, screws, and stints.  Its business involves production of both stock items and custom pieces for doctors at research hospitals.

At the end of the third quarter of 2006, it became clear to Ed Walters, chief operating officer, and Robin Smith, chief financial officer, that the company would not make the aggressive annual earnings target specified by the board of directors, and, in consequence, they would not receive bonuses that historically had averaged about 40 percent of their base compensation.  That’s when the two devised the following strategy.

“Here’s what we’ll do,” suggested Ed.  “We’ve never offered our customers a discount.  Let’s change that right now.  We’ll offer a 25 percent discount on all orders placed in October and November for delivery in December of 2006.”

“That will certainly boost fourth quarter sales,” said Robin.  “But, you know, it won’t really increase total sales.  It’ll just transfer some sales from the first quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2006.  Of course, 2006 is where we need earnings to hit our bonus target.  Hey, I’ve got another idea.  We can also jack-up production of our stock items in the fourth quarter.  With our high-priced production equipment, we’ve got a ton of overhead.  But the more we produce the more overhead we can bury in inventory.  With lower unit costs, and higher sales, profit will go way up.  Let’s get going on execution.  I’ve got to get the marketing people working on the promotion and you’ve got to update the production schedule.  This could end up being our best year ever in terms of bonuses!”

`To properly develop this ethics case, the student should identify any accounting or ethical issues, evaluate alternative courses of action, and make a decision as to which is best following the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) Statement of Ethical Professional Practice (Links to an external site.).  In doing so, the facts of the case need not be rehashed but only referenced to support a conclusion.  Good grammar, spelling, and logical development will be considered in assigning a grade.  The length of your response should be approximately one to two pages, double-spaced.`

1. Are the proposed actions of Ed and Robin ethical (make sure you address both proposals)?
   - No these actions are not ethical. Ed and Robin are using channel stuffing and over production in order to artificially boost there 2006 third quarter numbers just in time for bonuses. The actual amount of sales and money in will most likely not be the same after the third quarter because most of these sales will be returned and the discounted prices change there sale model for the products. There are also potential problems with increased productions where overhead could become too high for the company and they could run out of money/credit options. 
  
2. What is the likely effect of the actions on shareholder value?
   - What will most likely occur is that a down quarter will show after 2006 in the first quarter of 2007. This will then effect the companies overall profits and returns on investments which could lower the value of company shares. 
  
3. Does compliance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) equate to ethical behavior?
   - This depends on the scenario. Complying by GAAP principles when creating accounting documents means that you would be acting ethically but GAAP doesn't pertain to just general business practices. So the decisions that a company makes are not effected by GAAP as long as they have the correct financial documentation.  

4. What do you recommend?
   - Well I would recommend the termination of Ed and Robin since they are trying to create artificial earnings in order to get more money out of the company for there own gain. This is clear unethical behavior that shows they have no consideration for the company, its value, or the share holders.
