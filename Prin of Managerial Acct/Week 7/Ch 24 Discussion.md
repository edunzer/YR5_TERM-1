    3 insights you gained from the article

        There wasn't really any information that was new to me, but I did find these two points interesting. A lot of the time people have difficulty with budgeting because they cant keep the repetitive nature of it without getting bored. These two options help fix that by creating incentives to help with the retentiveness of a monthly budget. 

        Reward yourself: Give yourself a little extra motivation to follow your budget by setting up a rewards system. For example, if you’re under budget or if you keep up with your budget for a few months in a row, you can reward yourself with something you can afford and appreciate.

        Set budget date nights: If you have a spouse or partner, make a point to check in with them regularly. You can even set up fun “budget date nights” so it’s not a chore.  
    
    How you plan to apply what you learned about budgeting from the article.

        I personally already abide by everything that is stated in the article, the only possible difference is increasing my income with new jobs so that I can have a higher budget.
