`Ill choose "Break-even point" as my technique. The most recent example that I used this is after completing renovations on my last house. Since the renovation was completed we were thinking about moving so I decided to total up the amount spent on the renovation and then estimated cost of the house. This gave me a clear idea of the price the house would have to sell for to "break even" on all expenses that were put into the renovation plus the original cost of the house. `
