## CH 23 DISCUSSION

Choose ONE of the following to respond to for your intitial post (by Friday).

An incremental analysis indicates that Neinten Company’s VikMore segment is an unprofitable one. VikMore is a unique product that only three companies in the US manufacture. Should Neinten consider VikMore’s unique nature in addition to the results of the analysis when deciding whether to retain or eliminate the segment? Why or why not?

  
An incremental analysis indicates that Scott Industries could save money if a critical seal used in the manufacture of a product is purchased from a supplier instead of made by Scott. Scott decides to continue making its own seals. Why would Scott decide not to purchase the seals if doing so saves money?

  
Your roommate, Gale Dunham, is confused about sunk costs. Explain to your roommate the meaning of sunk costs and their relevance to a decision to retain or replace equipment. 

  
What is the decision rule in deciding whether to sell a product or process it further? 


Define the term "opportunity cost." How may this cost be relevant in a make-or-buy decision? 
 - An opportunity cost is a possible benefit that is lost when choosing an alternative. Most opportunity costs are unseen, and thus can be easily missed. Understanding and seeing these potential opportunities allows for better investment over other options. So to properly consider opportunity costs you have to view all options equally and thoroughly in order to make a decision that is not detrimental. This same situation happens in a make-or-buy decision where you have multiple options, specifically making product in house or purchasing externally. In order to make the right decision and not be effected by an opportunity cost you have to view and analysis both options.
