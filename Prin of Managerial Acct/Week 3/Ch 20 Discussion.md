## CH 20 DISCUSSION 

                    House 1         House 2         House 3
Direct Materials    140000          70000           90000   
Direct Labor        210000          130000          60000   
Overhead            ?               ?               ?

*Total indirect costs such as supervisory salaries and indirect materials amount to $84,000.

 
My house is house number one.  I believe distributing the overhead costs equally among the three houses is a fair way to allocate them.  My specific recommendation is:

$84,000 overhead / 3 houses = $28,000 per house. 

Your house is house number three.  Do you agree with this assignment of cost? Submit an initial post by Friday explaining why or why not. Include your own recommendation to allocate the $84,000 of overhead costs. Based on your suggestion indicate the amount of overhead costs to be assigned to each of the three houses. Each member of the group must come up with a different method to allocate costs...so it pays to post early this week. (You will only be able to see the posts of members of your group). 

- The above recommendation assigns more overhead than seems reasonable to the lower cost houses.  The houses that require more direct materials and direct labor is more likely to require greater amounts of overhead. Therefore an equal overhead distribution as seen in the recommendation is likely wrong.

The better distribution system uses indirect materials costs and fringe benefit costs to determine where more and less overhead should be located but since those numbers are not present they have to be inferred based on the direct costs. The amount of indirect costs is probably related to the direct costs.  

Direct materials cost is a logical basis for indirect materials cost.  Fringe benefit costs are connected to supervisory time therefore direct labor cost is a logical basis for fringe benefit costs. 

New Overhead assignment :

House 1: $40,425

House 2: $21,525

House 3: $22,050
