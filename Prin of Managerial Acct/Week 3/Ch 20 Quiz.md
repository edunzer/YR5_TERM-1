Question 2
1 / 1 pts
Simmons Inc. applies overhead to production at a predetermined rate of 90% based on direct labor cost. Job No. 250, the only job still in process at the end of August, has been charged with manufacturing overhead of $8,100. What was the amount of direct materials charged to Job 250 assuming the balance in Work in Process inventory is $30,000?

Correct!
  $12,900. 

$8,100 ÷ 90% = $9,000; X + $9,000 + $8,100 = $30,000; X = $12,900
(Manufacturing overhead ÷ Overhead rate = Direct labor cost; Direct materials + Direct labor + Manufacturing overhead applied = Total manufacturing cost of job)

 
Question 3

Question 4
1 / 1 pts
Henson Company applies overhead on the basis of 120% of direct labor cost. Job No. 190 is charged with $140,000 of direct materials costs and $180,000 of manufacturing overhead. The total manufacturing costs for Job No. 190 is

Correct!
  $470,000. 
$180,000 ÷ 120% = $150,000; $140,000 + $150,000 + $180,000 = $470,000
(Manufacturing overhead ÷ Overhead rate = Direct labor cost; Direct materials + Direct labor + Manufacturing overhead applied = Total manufacturing cost of job)

Correct!
  breakfast cereal. 

 
Question 6
1 / 1 pts
A company expected its annual overhead costs to be $1,500,000 and direct labor costs to be $1,000,000. Actual overhead was $1,450,000, and actual labor costs totaled $1,100,000. How much is the company’s predetermined overhead rate to the nearest cent?

Correct!
  $1.50 

$1,500,000 ÷ $1,000,000 = $1.50
(Estimated overhead ÷ Estimated direct labor cost = Predetermined overhead rate)

 
Question 7
1 / 1 pts
At the beginning of the year, Monroe Company estimates annual overhead costs to be $2,400,000 and that 300,000 machine hours will be operated. Using machine hours as a base, the amount of overhead applied during the year if actual machine hours for the year was 315,000 hours is
 
Correct!
  $2,520,000. 
$2,400,000 ÷ 300,000 = $8.00 per direct labor hour; 315,000 x $8 = $2,520,000
(Estimated overhead ÷ Estimated direct labor hours = Predetermined overhead rate; Actual machine hours x Predetermined overhead rate = Overhead applied)

 
Question 8
1 / 1 pts
Kinney Company applies overhead on the basis of 150% of direct labor cost. Job No. 176 is charged with $150,000 of direct materials costs and $180,000 of manufacturing overhead. The total manufacturing costs for Job No. 176 is
 
Correct!
  $450,000. 
 
$180,000 ÷ 150% = $120,000; $150,000 + $120,000 + $180,000 = $450,000
(Manufacturing overhead ÷ Overhead rate = Direct labor cost; Direct materials + Direct labor + Manufacturing overhead applied = Total manufacturing cost of job)

 
Question 9
1 / 1 pts
If, at the end of the year, Manufacturing Overhead has been overapplied, it means that
  
Correct!
  actual overhead costs were less than the overhead assigned to jobs. 

 
Question 10
1 / 1 pts
Barger Company had the following information at December 31:



If the cost of goods manufactured during the year amounted to $1,895,000 and annual sales were $2,994,000, how much is the amount of gross profit for the year?

Correct!
  $1,135,000 
$90,000 + $1,895,000 - $126,000 = $1,859,000; $2,994,000 - $1,859,000 = $1,135,000
(Beginning finished goods inventory + Cost of goods manufactured - Ending finished goods inventory = Cost of goods sold; Sales - Cost of goods sold = Gross profit)
