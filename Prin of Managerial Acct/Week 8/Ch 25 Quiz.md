Rhein Manufacturing recorded operating data for its auto accessories division for the year.
Sales $750,000

How much is ROI for the year if management is able to identify a way to improve the contribution margin by $30,000, assuming fixed costs are held constant?

Correct!
  22.5% 

($150,000 + $30,000 - $90,000) / $400,000 = .225 or 22.5%
