## CH 21 DISCUSSION 

Search YouTube for "How it's made." Select one of the videos to review, then answer the following questions in your initial post (by Friday).  Choose a different episode from others in your group. (You will only be able to see the posts of members of your group).  

- What product did you choose?  Post a link to the video, or better yet embed the video using the studio tool.
  I picked Tissues as my "How its made" video. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n8gNyIOZDM)
- Describe in sequence the primary steps used to manufacture the product. 
  1. First they used recycled printer paper
  2. Then that paper went into the pulper which is a giant container that breaks up the paper into fibers with water and turning forks. This creates the paper pulp. 
  3. Next they inject the pulp with air which causes the ink to detach from the pulp andd cling to the air bubbles in the mixer. the bubbles rise to the top and then separate and drain off.
  4. The ink free pulp now goes through several rollers which squeezes out the water from the pulp. 
  5. At the end of the rollers there is a screw conveyer which then breaks up those newly compressed sheets into separated bits again. 
  6. Then those separated bits of pulp get rinsed with clean water. 
  7. That freshly cleaned pulp is then put into the paper machine that injects the pulp onto a screen convey belt. 
  8. Then it gets passed through rollers again to press out the water to form sheets. 
  9. It then get dried by hot air. 
  10. And finally gets rolled up into paper rolls. 
  11. That roll then gets put into the converting machine 
  12. First it is unwound to get the paper as thin as possible. 
  13. Then two sheets are put together to form a 2 ply sheet. 
  14. Then cuts are created in the new sheet by stamping knifes that form the tissue squares. 
  15. Those "stamped"/cut 2 ply sheets then meet up with another set of 2 ply sheets and get pressed together making a 4 ply sheet. 
  16. Then that gets folder and stacked in the interlocking fashion you find in tissue containers. 
  17. The result is a 5ft wide rows of folded tissue. 
  18. Then that rows is separated from 5 ft to the format of a typical tissue. 
  19. Then those changed rows get cut again to separate the stacks into stacks. 
  20. Those individual stacks are then moved over to the boxing station. 
  21. Flattened boxes are grabbed from a stack by a machine which then unfolds them and refolds them into the box shape. 
  22. Those new boxes are then put next to the tissue stack and pushed in.
  23. The boxes are then finally sealed. 

- Explain the costs incurred by the company that would fall into each of the following categories: 
    materials: Are very simple. You first have the recycled paper, then the boxes and then the water and chemicals that mixes with the pulp. 
    labor: Is very low. All the machines are autonomous so only labor that is needed is repair and supervisors incase of faults in the machine line. 
    overhead: Would be the machine costs, so running them, maintaining them and then what is stated above. 
- Which do you think would be the greatest cost in making this product?
    The initial cost of the machines would probably cost the most. There are many and they are complicated. 
- Discuss whether the manufacturer would use job order costing or process costing.
    Process costing would be used since this facility only makes one product and would need to determine the cost of the machines to build into the cost of the single product that they create.
