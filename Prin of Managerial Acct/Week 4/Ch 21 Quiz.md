## CH 21 DISCUSSION

Question 1
1 / 1 pts
Super-Tech Industries had the following department information about physical units and percentage of completion:

If materials are added at the beginning of the production process, what is the total number of equivalent units for materials during June?
 
Correct!
  34,000. 
 
(12,000 units x 100%) + 22,000 = 34,000
[(Ending WIP units x % complete) + Units completed and transferred = Equivalent units]

 
Question 2
1 / 1 pts
In the month of June, a department had 20,000 units in beginning work in process that were 70% complete. During June, 90,000 units were transferred into production from another department. At the end of June there were 10,000 units in ending work in process that were 40% complete. Materials are added at the beginning of the process, while conversion costs are incurred uniformly throughout the process. How many units were transferred out of the process in June?

Correct!
  100,000 units. 

20,000 + 90,000 - 10,000 = 100,000
(Beginning WIP units + Units transferred in - Ending WIP units = Units transferred out)

 
Question 3

Gantner Company had the following department information about physical units and percentage of completion:

If materials are added at the beginning of the production process, what is the total number of equivalent units for materials during May?

Correct!
  230,000. 
  
(50,000 units x 100%) + 180,000 = 230,000
[(Ending WIP units x % complete) + Units completed and transferred = Equivalent units]

 
Question 4
1 / 1 pts
The Wrapping Department’s output during the period consists of 21,000 units completed and transferred out, and 900 units in ending work in process that were 75% complete as to materials and conversion costs. Beginning inventory was 1,200 units that were 30% complete as to materials and conversion costs. Under the FIFO method, what are the equivalent units of production for materials?

Correct!
  21,315 
21,000 + (900 * .75) - (1,200 x .30) = 21,315
(Units completed and transferred + (Ending work in process x % complete as to materials) - (Beginning inventory x % complete as to materials))

 
Question 5
1 / 1 pts
The total costs accounted for in a production cost report equal the
 
Correct!
  cost of units completed and transferred out plus the cost of ending work in process. 

 
Question 6
1 / 1 pts
Madison Industries has equivalent units of 8,000 for materials and for conversion costs. Total manufacturing costs are $200,000. Total materials costs are $150,000. How much is the conversion cost per unit?

Correct!
  $6.25. 

($200,000 - $150,000) ÷ 8,000 = $6.25
[(Total manufacturing cost - Total materials cost) ÷ Equivalent units = Unit cost, conversion]

 
Question 7
1 / 1 pts
In the Camria Company, materials are entered at the beginning of the process. If there is no beginning work in process, but there is an ending work in process inventory, the number of equivalent units as to materials costs will be
Correct!
  the same as the units started. 

 
Question 8
0 / 1 pts
Chicotti Company has 6,000 units in beginning work in process, 30% complete as to conversion costs, 75,000 units transferred out to finished goods, and 2,000 units in ending work in process 20% complete as to conversion costs. The beginning and ending inventory is fully complete as to materials costs. How much are equivalent units for conversion costs if the FIFO method is used?
You Answered
  75,400 
Correct Answer
  73,600 
75,000 + (2,000 x .20) - (6,000 x .30) = $73,600
(Units transferred out + (Ending work in process x % complete as to conversion costs) - (Beginning work in process x % complete as to conversion costs))

 
Question 9
1 / 1 pts
In a process cost system,

Correct!
  a Work in Process account is maintained for each process. 

 
Question 10
1 / 1 pts
Madison Industries has equivalent units of 8,000 for materials and for conversion costs. Total manufacturing costs are $128,000. Total materials costs are $96,000. How much is the conversion cost per unit?

Correct!
  $4. 

($96,000 ÷ 8,000) = $12; ($128,000 ÷ 8,000) = $16; $16 - $12 = $4
[(Total materials cost ÷ Equivalent units = Unit cost, materials); (Total manufacturing cost ÷ Equivalent units = Unit cost, total manufacturing cost); Unit cost, total manufacturing cost - Unit cost, materials = Unit cost, conversion]
